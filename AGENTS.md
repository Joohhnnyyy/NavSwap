## Project Summary
This project is a high-fidelity clone of the "THE SHIFT" website (https://theshift.tokyo/). It is a minimalist, avant-garde portfolio site for a Tokyo-based creative collective. The site features editorial-grade typography, kinetic animations, and a sophisticated light/dark alternating theme.

## Tech Stack
- Framework: Next.js (App Router)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Animation: Lucide React for icons, custom CSS animations, and character-splitting kinetic typography patterns.
- Fonts: Inter, Noto Serif JP, Noto Sans JP.

## Architecture
- `src/app/`: Contains the main page and layout.
- `src/components/sections/`: Contains individual sections of the website (Header, Hero, Project Slider, What We Do, Featured List, Territory Footer).
- `src/app/globals.css`: Contains the global styles, typography scale, and color palette.

## User Preferences
- Minimalist Avant-Garde aesthetic.
- Editorial-grade typography.
- Kinetic typography animations.

## Project Guidelines
- Maintain a high-contrast "Theatrical Light/Dark" alternating section pattern.
- Use intentional vertical rhythm (15vh padding).
- Follow the custom typography scale and color palette defined in `globals.css`.

## Common Patterns
- Kinetic typography (splitting characters into individual divs for animation).
- Border reveal animations on scroll.
- Circular masks for project previews.
- Parentheses framing for numbers/UI elements.
